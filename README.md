# DESCRIPTION:

THIS PROJECT IS A DYNAMIC AND INTERACTIVE CHATBOT INTERFACE DEVELOPED USING CORE WEB TECHNOLOGIES: HTML, CSS, AND JAVASCRIPT. IT PROVIDES A USER-FRIENDLY POP-UP CHAT WINDOW DESIGNED FOR SEAMLESS COMMUNICATION.

THE HTML STRUCTURE ORGANIZES THE CHATBOT'S COMPONENTS, INCLUDING A HEADER WITH A LOGO AND CLOSE BUTTON, A BODY TO DISPLAY MESSAGES, AND A FOOTER CONTAINING an input field, emoji picker, file upload functionality, and a send button. The CSS, linked via a stylesheet, handles the visual presentation, ensuring a clean and responsive layout. It utilizes Material Symbols for icons, enhancing the user interface.

JAVASCRIPT POWERS THE CHATBOT'S INTERACTIVITY. It handles sending and receiving messages, displaying them in the chat body, managing file uploads (image only), and integrating an emoji picker. The code interacts with a Gemini API (though the API key is partially obscured in the provided snippet) to generate bot responses based on user input and uploaded files. It dynamically updates the chat history and scrolls to the latest messages.

KEY FUNCTIONALITIES IMPLEMENTED INCLUDE:

Dynamic Message Display: Adding user and bot messages to the chat interface.
API Integration: Sending user messages and file data to a backend API and displaying the bot's response.
File Upload: Allowing users to upload image files as part of their messages.
Emoji Picker: Providing a user-friendly way to include emojis in messages.
Responsive Input:Adjusting the input field's height based on the content.
Enter Key Handling: Sending messages when the Enter key is pressed (with conditions for wider screens and no Shift key).
File Upload Preview and Cancellation: Displaying a preview of the selected image and allowing the user to cancel the upload.

EXTERNAL LIBRARIES USED:

Emoji Mart: For implementing the emoji picker functionality.
Google Fonts (Material Symbols): For providing consistent and scalable icons.

THE APPLICATION RUNS DIRECTLY IN THE BROWSER BY OPENING THE HTML FILE. THE JAVASCRIPT HANDLES ALL THE FRONTEND LOGIC AND COMMUNICATES WITH THE EXTERNAL API FOR BOT RESPONSES.

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS COULD INCLUDE: Handling more file types, improving the visual design, adding more sophisticated bot logic, implementing user authentication, and storing chat history.

WORKING ON THIS PROJECT DEMONSTRATES SKILLS IN DOM MANIPULATION, EVENT HANDLING, ASYNCHRONOUS JAVASCRIPT (FETCH API), FORM HANDLING, AND INTEGRATING EXTERNAL LIBRARIES TO BUILD A FUNCTIONAL AND INTERACTIVE USER INTERFACE. IT HIGHLIGHTS THE ABILITY TO CREATE A REAL-TIME COMMUNICATION INTERFACE USING FUNDAMENTAL WEB DEVELOPMENT TECHNOLOGIES.
